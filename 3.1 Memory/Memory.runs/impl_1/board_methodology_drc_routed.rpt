2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net swb_IBUF[3] is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): addra[5]_i_1/I4, myRAM/clka, swb_IBUF[3]_inst/O, toggle_BUFG_inst_i_1/I0, wea_i_1/I4, dina[31]_i_1/I4
